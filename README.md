# RouteDokanPassport
A WIP Super Mario 3D World mod porter that is capable of porting mods between version.
## Features
It only supports porting from Wii U to Switch and only ObjectData and StageData. Other formats may be available in the future.
## Known issues
Some stages may throw an overflow exception and freeze the aplication; if that happens, use the console version and send the error in the issues tab.<br>
Stages aren't changed so objects that aren't in the switch version may be replaced manually.<br>
There could be a possibility where some objects don't work as expected, please create an issue and explain your problem.
